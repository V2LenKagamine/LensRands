Len's Randoms is a hellscape created for the sole purpose of tormenting others. This should not be used unless you too enjoy poorly coded references and stupid items in your terraria game.

Do note: Items may change, become existn't,and this mod may stop being updated or update 5 times in a day.
Who knows.
Point is, you probably shouldn't use it unless you know me personally or are a madlad.

If you want actual features: heres a list;
Several RiskOfRain themed items/mechanics.
Monika pet.
Some Warframe Items.
Some stupid memes and injoke items.
Early Game Gem weapons.
Stolen code and assets.
